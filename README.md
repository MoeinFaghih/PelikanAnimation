🦢 Pelican Animation in C & OpenGL

A simple yet engaging OpenGL project developed in C that animates a pelican using basic primitive shapes. The pelican moves, flaps its wings, and interacts with the environment dynamically! 🚀

✨ Features

🎮 Smooth Animation: The pelican moves left and right while its wings flap up and down.

🖱 Interactive Curtains: Right-click to pull the curtains open or close them.

⬆⬇ Vertical Movement: Control the pelican's altitude using the Up and Down arrow keys.

⏩⏪ Adjustable Speed: Increase or decrease movement speed with the Right and Left arrow keys.

⚠ Speed Alerts: A warning message appears when reaching maximum or minimum speed limits.

🏚 Breakable Wall Pattern: A custom algorithm displays a breaking pattern on the wall when interacted with.
